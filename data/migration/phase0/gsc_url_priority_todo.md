## Migration TODO
- [ ] Move all P0 missing URLs into an explicit decision matrix: 'migrate', 'redirect', or 'sunset'.
- [ ] For any URL marked 'redirect', add to redirect seed/matrix with target + reason.
- [ ] Add all approved 'migrate' URLs to /Users/daveblake/Documents/GitHub/dave-blake-site/src/data/seo/route-contract.json.
- [ ] Keep a weekly GSC refresh cadence during migration; regenerate this file after each pull.
- [ ] Block launch until every high-value URL has a non-404 outcome in staging.
